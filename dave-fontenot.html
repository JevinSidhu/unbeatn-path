                    <h1 class="main-header"> Why I&rsquo;m not going back to school </h1>
                    <h3 class="main-subheader"> You don&rsquo;t fly by your peers by sitting next to them in class. </h3>

                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    I recently decided not to return to the University of Michigan this Fall. </p>

                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    I love college: great friends, nonstop fun, and a stellar educational experience all wrapped into one four-year package. College comes at a price, but I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do with myself for the four years after high school. The University of Michigan, my dream school, made it easy when they offered me nearly a full ride. So why then did I dropout? </p>
                    
                    <img class="center-block img-responsive article-img" src="http://i.imgur.com/k5kv8Aa.jpg">

                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    In March, I came to a conclusion that I couldn&rsquo;t deny; school was hindering my personal growth which had been rapidly accelerating since I had arrived at Michigan. As much as I loved my classes, the amount of mindshare I had to devote to them was beginning to cap off the velocity of my growth outside of school. Having just dove headfirst into the field of Computer Science, I wasn&rsquo;t going to catch up to the students who had been hacking away since puberty by sitting right next to them in class, doing the exact same things they were doing; it was time to do something different. </p>
                    
                     <h4 class="important-text">
                        I had never even seen a single line of code before college.

                     <p class="main-text"> 
                    I didn&rsquo;t drop out because of money. I didn&rsquo;t drop out to pursue a short-term opportunity. I dropped out because I didn&rsquo;t want to move at the same pace as everyone else; I wanted to fly by my peers and maximize my personal growth. <a class="links" href="https://sivers.org/kimo"> School only moves so fast. </a></p>
                    
                    
                    <p class="minor-header"> How I came to this conclusion: Hackathons. </p>

                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    Just over a year ago, I had an intense conversation with my partner in crime, Raj. He wanted to drop out.</p>
                    
                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    Having never even considered the possibility, I did everything in my power to convince him to stay. He decided to return concluding: “if college is a ticket to four years of fun, count me in.” I still think this is one of the best reasons to stay in college.</p>                   
 
                     <p class="main-text"> 
                    Speaking with Jack Dorsey, one of the founders of Twitter, on his visit to Michigan, I remembered the conversation I had with Raj and asked Jack why he had dropped out. He told me that he decided to leave school when he realized that it was no longer maximizing his personal growth. This was the first time I ever considered the idea of dropping out. Previously, I had always thought that dropping out was an optimization for a short-term opportunity at the cost of your long-term growth; Jack very confidently pointed out that this was not the case. Two hours later, we left on our first trip to PennApps, then the largest student hackathon in the world. This was just the start. </p>
                    
                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    Shortly before our sophomore year, Raj and I decided that we wanted to travel to five cities: New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston. Entering the semester, we had no idea that we would actually even pull off more than one; three months later, we had travelled to 4 of the 5 (sorry, Boston). Every other weekend, we were out of town chasing some opportunity or building something crazy at one of the over a dozen hackathons we attended by the close of 2012. </p>                   
 
                     <p class="main-text"> I became addicted.</p>
                    
                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    At a hackathon, I could do anything; in less than 48 hours, we could build anything we could imagine, pick up a new technology/language/framework faster than I ever thought possible, and every time I became a better and better hacker. The growth was seemingly limitless, and in February of 2013 I shared this discovery with 500 other hackers, throwing the inaugural MHacks.</p>                   

                     <p class="minor-header"> How I came to this conclusion: Market Loco </p>

                     <p class="main-text"> 
                    It wasn&rsquo;t just about the hacks. Throughout the year, we had been working on a project that ended up lasting much longer than a weekend. In December, Market Loco, a marketplace completely built on mobile phone numbers rather than email, hit an inflection point and really started to grow. </p>
                    
                    <p class="important-text"> 
                    We looked back a week, a month, a year, and it was as if we too were experiencing hockey stick personal growth. </p>                   
 
                     <p class="main-text"> 
                    Learning a ton every day, the more energy we sunk into the product, the more users we had and the better we understood what we were doing. This was really cool. I was working on something I cared a ton about and learning significantly more than I could in semesters upon semesters of classes. </p>
